# Denoising-Autoencoder-Spectral-Data
This is the repo for denosing of spectral data from the private rat lung dataset. The dataset originally in .mat file, which is converted into three .npy (Numpy Arrays) files, one file contains the original "Data", second file contains its "Background" and third file contains the "Wavelenghts". The code is developed to denoise the signals using Autoencoders whcih has to be validated with the SNR and the co-relation computatation. I used Pytorch framework on Jupyter  Notebook, as we have Cuda 12.8 version using on Tesla V100 32 GB GPU x 8 for training and testing.
